# Victoria & Albert Museum Search

This project is for CI527 Web Application development. 

The following project uses the public API of the Victoria & Albert Museum to search and browser the museum's collection. 

The website features a dynamic, responsive Single Page Application (SPA) and uses asynchronous HTTP requests to query the API with the search term. This project uses only vanilla HTML, CSS and JS; no frameworks or external libraries are to be used.
